# Image-Deconvolution-Wiener-Hunt-method
This practical work deals with the problem of image de-blurring, that is how to retrieve a sharp image starting from the blurred (and noisy) version of it. This problem belongs to the class of inverse problems which arise when one is working with real measurement systems. This in view of the fact that each measurement system, e.g., thermometer, CCD camera, spectrograph,. . . has its limitations imposed by the underlying physics, e.g., a ﬁnite precision, a ﬁnite dynamical range, a non-zero response time,. . . . This means that the measured quantity is a deformed version, in a given sense and within a given measure, of the physical quantity of interest.
